## Foundry Back end 

**Notes**
- For OFT / LayerZero docs, see: https://docs.layerzero.network/v2 and https://docs.layerzero.network/cookbook/using-foundry for setup in foundry
  - It is buggy though, watch out. 
- NB: If we want to use layerZero v2, we are forced to use openZeppelin v4. Not v5. 
- NB! SEE: https://tokenbound-v3-deployer.vercel.app/. There is a LayerZero V2 Executor! ... this seems to be an opportunity :)
